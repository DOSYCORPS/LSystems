# Random L-Systems Visualizer


## How to use this site:

**[Click here to start the visualization](/lsystems.hmtl)**

Clicking anywhere on the visualization will bring up a menu with a bunch of sliders you can use to change how the L-Systems are generated. Clicking off the menu will make it disppear. Using the menu you can control the following parameters: 

- **_Fade time_**: The time it takes for a line to completely fade away

- **_Line length_**: The length of the shortest possible straight line (the distance that the turtle moves when it is told to move forward)
 
- **_Line width_**: The width of the lines being drawn

- **_Lines per frame_**: The number of lines that are drawn every frame

- **_Time per frame_**: How often a frame is drawn

- **_Angle randomness_**: 100% angle randomness means all angles are randomly chosen from between 5째 and 180째. 0% angle randomness means all angles are chosen from a pool of around 10 "nice looking" angles (such as 90째, 20째, etc)

- **_Maximum system length_**: The length to grow each system's string before switching to a new system     

The remaining parameters are explained in the following diagram of a complete L-System:

If you want to share your current settings you can click the **_save settings in url_** button at the bottom of the menu and it will change the URL of the page to one that includes all the current parameters.

## A brief explanation of L-Systems:


### Growing an L-System

An L-System is a string rewriting system that can generate fractal and tree like structures. They consist of a **seed** string and a set of **rules** to grow the seed into a more complex string. Each rule operates on a single character of the string, and replaces that character with another string.
For example, consider the following seed and rules:  
```
Seed: "abc"  
Rules:  
    "a" -> "cc",  
    "c" -> "ba"  
```

Applying these rules to the seed will yield the string `"ccbba"`. Now the same rules can be applied to this new string to grow the system even more:  

`"ccbba"` becomes `"bababbcc"`  
`"bababbcc"` becomes `"bccbccbbbaba"`  
etc


### Visualizing an L-System

L-Systems can be visualized in many different ways, but the most common method involves using a [turtle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics).  
First, you come up with an L-System as well as an arbitrary angle, **A**, to associate the L-System with. Then, you grow your L-System string by applying rules to the seed numerous times. To draw the L-System using the turtle you interpret every character of the grown string as an instruction to the turtle. Most L-Systems visualizers (including this one) use the following character set:

- "F": Move the turtle forward
- "+": Turn the turtle A degrees clockwise
- "-": Turn the turtle A degrees counterclockwise
- "[": Push the current position of the turtle onto a stack
- "]": Pop a position off the stack and move the turtle to that position

Any other characters can be ignored by the turtle.
